    <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is considered to be one of the greatest musical minds that ever lived, his genius lives on on the hundreds of compositions that have captivated the minds and hearts of, not only millions of people that enjoy them, but also most of the best composers to this day.</p>
    <p>There are many beautiful stories and anecdotes about him, and much of his personality has survived through his body of work and also through the extensive amount of letters that he exchanged with his family members.</p>
    <p>I will share here only one short and well documented anecdote, if you are interested in learning more about this incredible master I encourage you to follow this <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">link</a>, since I will not get into the biographical details here.</p>

  <div class="container" id="anecdote">
    <p>There was a time when certain musical works where considered sacred, this was the case with the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36Y_ztEW1NE">Miserere, by Gregorio Allegri</a>.</p>
    <p>This remarkable work was to be performed in the Vatican only during passover, and never written down under penalty of excommunication. This did not stop young Mozart, who sat down at mass to hear the work, and rushed home to write it down (from memory).
    <p>I leave you now with a few quotes:</p>
